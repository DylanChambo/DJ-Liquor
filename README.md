We have developed an android app using Java that allows users to browse for different liquor.

### Features:
1. You can search for products by name.
2. You can browse for products by category.
3. You can visit the detail view activity to get more information about a product.
4. You can browse the top 3 most popular items that dynamically change as you browse through the app.
5. You can add items to cart and view your total

### Changes from design:
1. We have changed the search bar to be part of the top bar as it felt more natural
2. We have changed the class structure from our docs as we didnt include all the neccesary adaptors for list, grid and recycler views.
and we decided to only use one product class with an enum for the category rather than each category being a subclass of product.
3. Since we had time we decided to add a cart even though it wasnt neccesary as without it our app did not have much functionality.
